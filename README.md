# Machine Learning

### Background Information 
Hi, Welcome to my Github page - Web Scrapping section.
This is a Machine Learning project I conducted as a team with other graudate cohort at the Carlson School of Managemnet. As a team, we are creating an auto loan default classifier with 1 as default and 0 as no default.

### Language Used 
- Jupyter Notebook: Python

### Computing Machine Used 
- Google Cloud Platform Virtual Machine (8 vCPUs, 32 GB memory)
- apply *tmux* to prevent VM from crashing 

### Machine Learning Methods Used 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 
- XGboost

### Files Desriptions 
- *cti_ipynb*: Jupyter Notebook code used to apply Decision Tree and Random Forest models on the auto loan dataset
- *cti_testing*: Jupyter Notebook code used to evluate using Cross Validation scoring metrics on Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGboost 
- *cti_xgboost.ipynb*: Jupyter Notebook code used to apply XGboost model on the auto loan dataset
